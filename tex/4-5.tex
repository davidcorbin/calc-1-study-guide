\section*{4.5 Substitution Rule}

\subsection*{Substitution Rule for Indefinite Integrals}

If \(u=g(x)\) is a differentiable function whose range is an interval \(I\) and \(f\) is continuous on \(I\), then
$$ \int f(g(x))g'(x)dx = \int f(u)du $$ 

\subsection*{Substitution Rule for Definite Integrals}

If \(g'\) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and \(f\) is continuous on the range of \(u=g(x)\), then 
$$ \int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x)dx=\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}f(u)du $$

\subsection*{Integrals of Symmetric Functions}

Suppose \(f\) is continuous on \([-a, a]\).
$$ \text{If } f \text{ is even } [f(-x)=f(x)] \text{, then } \int_{-a}^a f(x)dx = 2 \int_{0}^{a} f(x)dx. $$
$$ \text{If } f \text{ is odd } [f(-x)=-f(x)] \text{, then } \int_{-a}^a f(x)dx = 0. $$
