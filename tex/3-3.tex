\section*{3.3 Graphing Derivatives}

\subsection*{Increasing/Decreasing Test}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(f'(x)>0\) on an interval, then \(f\) is increasing on that interval.
    \item If \(f'(x)<0\) on an interval, then \(f\) is decreasing on that interval.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{First Derivative Test}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(f'\) changes from positive to negative at \(c\), then \(f\) has a \textbf{local maximum} at \(c\).
    \item If \(f'\) changes from negative to positive at \(c\), then \(f\) has a \textbf{local minimum} at \(c\).
    \item If \(f'\) is positive to the left and right of \(c\), or negative to the left and right of \(c\), then \(f\) has no local maximum or minimum at \(c\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Concavity Test}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(f''(x) > 0\) for all \(x\) in \(I\), then the graph of \(f\) is concave upward on
\(I\).
    \item If \(f''(x) < 0\) for all \(x\) in \(I\), then the graph of \(f\) is concave downward on \(I\).
\end{itemize}
If the graph of \(f\) lies above all of its tangents on an interval \(I\), then it is called concave upward on \(I\). If the graph of \(f\) lies below all of its tangents on \(I\), it is called concave downward on \(I\).
\\\\
A point \(P\) on a curve \(y=f(x)\) is called an \textbf{inflection point} if \(f\) is continuous there and the curve changes from concave upward to concave downward or vice versa.

\subsection*{Second Derivative Test}

Suppose \(f''(x)\) is continuous near \(c\).
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(f'(c) = 0\) and \(f''(c) > 0\), then \(f\) has a local minimum at \(c\).
    \item If \(f'(c) = 0\) and \(f''(c) < 0\), then \(f\) has a local maximum at \(c\).
\end{itemize}
