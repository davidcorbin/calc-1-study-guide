\section*{1.1 Representing Functions}

A \textbf{function} \(f\) is a rule that assigns to each element \(x\) in set \(D\) exactly one element, called \(f(x)\), in a set \(E\).
\\\\
\textbf{Vertical Line Test}: A curve in the \(xy\)-plane is the graph of a function of \(x\) if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.
\\\\
A \textbf{piecewise function} is a function defined for multiple sub-functions applying to a certain interval of the main function's domain.

\[ f(x)=
    \begin{cases} 
      1-x & x\leq -1 \\
      \frac{3-x}{4} & -1 < x < 100 \\
      2x & x\geq 100
   \end{cases}
\]
\\
A function is \textbf{even} if \(f(-x)=f(x)\) for every number \(x\) in its domain.
\\\\
A function is \textbf{odd} if \(f(-x)=-f(x)\) for every number \(x\) in its domain.
\\\\
A function \(f\) is \textbf{decreasing} on an interval \(I\) if \(f(x_1)<f(x_2)\) whenever \(x_1 < x_2\) in \(I\).
A function \(f\) is \textbf{increasing} on \(I\) if \(f(x_1)>f(x_2)\) whenever \(x_1<x_2\) in \(I\).
