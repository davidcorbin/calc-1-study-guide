\section*{1.1 Representing Functions}

A function \(f\) is a rule that assigns to each element \(x\) in set \(D\) exactly one element, called \(f(x)\), in a set \(E\).\\

Vertical Line Test: A curve in the \(xy\)-plane is the graph of a function of \(x\) if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.\\

A piecewise function is a function defined for multiple sub-functions applying to a certain intergal of the main function's domain.\\


\[ f(x)=
    \begin{cases} 
      1-x & x\leq -1 \\
      \frac{3-x}{4} & -1 < x < 100 \\
      2x & x\geq 100
   \end{cases}
\]\\

A function is even if \(f(-x)=f(x)\) for every number \(x\) in its domain.\\

A function is odd if \(f(-x)=-f(x)\) for every number \(x\) in its domain.\\

A function \(f\) is decreasing on an interval \(I\) if \(f(x_1)<f(x_2)\) whenever \(x_1 < x_2\) in \(I\).

A function \(f\) is increasing on \(I\) if \(f(x_1)>f(x_2)\) whenever \(x_1<x_2\) in \(I\).\\
