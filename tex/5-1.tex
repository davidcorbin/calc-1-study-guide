\section*{5.1 Areas Between Curves}

The area \(a\) bounded by the curves \(y=f(x), y=g(x)\), and the lines \(x=a, x=b\), where \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous and \(f(x) \geq g(x)\) for all \(x\) in \([a, b]\), is 
\[ A = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n[f(x_i^*)-g(x_i^*)]\delta x \Leftrightarrow \int_a^b[f(x)-g(x)]dx \] 
The area between the curves \(y=f(x)\) and \(y=g(x)\) and between \(x=a\) and \(x=b\) is 
\[ A = \int_a^b \left | f(x)-g(x) \right | dx \]
