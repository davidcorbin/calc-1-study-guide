    \item \(\frac{d}{dx}(c)=0\) \quad where \(c\) is a constant
    \item \(\frac{d}{dx}(x)=1\)
    \item \(\frac{d}{dx}(x^n)=nx^{n-1}\) \quad if \(n\) is a positive integer
    \item \(\frac{d}{dx}[cf(x)]=c\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\) \quad where \(c\) is a constant and \(f(x)\) is differentiable

    \item \(\frac{d}{dx}[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}]=\frac{g(x)\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]-f(x)\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]}{g(x)^2}\) \quad if \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable
