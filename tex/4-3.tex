\section*{4.3 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}

\subsection*{FTC Part 1}

If \(f\) is continuous on \([a, b]\), then the function \(g\) defined by 
$$ g(x) = \int_a^x f(t)dt \quad a \leq x \leq b $$
is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b)\), and \(g'(x)=f(x)\).

\subsection*{FTC Part 2}

If \(f\) is continuous on \([a, b]\), then 
$$ \int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b)- F(a) $$
where \(F\) is any antiderivative of \(f\), that is, a function \(F\) such that \(F'=f\).
