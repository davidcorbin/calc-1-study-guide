\section*{2.2 Derivatives as Functions}

$$f'(x)=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
\(f'(x)\) can be interpreted geometrically as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \(f\) at the point \((x, f(x))\)
\\\\
A function \(f\) is \(\textbf{differentiable}\) at \(a\) if \(f'(a)\) exists. It is differentiable on an open interval \((a,b)\) if it is differnetiable at every number in the interval.
\\\\
If \(f\) is differentiable at \(a\), the \(f\) is continuous at \(a\).

\subsection*{Ways a Function can be Discontinuous}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item corner point
    \item discontinuity
    \item vertical tangent
\end{enumerate}
