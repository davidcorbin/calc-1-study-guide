\section*{1.2 Types of Functions}

A linear function can be written in \textbf{slope-intercept form} (\(y=mx+b\)) where \(m\) is the slope of the line and \(b\) is the y-intercept.
\\\\
A function \(P\) is a \textbf{polynomial} if 
$$P(x)=a_n{x}^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ \cdots +a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$$
where n is a non-negative integer and the numbers \(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots ,a_n\) are constants called the \textbf{coefficients} of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is \(\mathbb{R} = (-\infty, \infty)\). If the coefficient \(a_n \neq 0\), then the degree of the polynomial is \(n\).
\\\\
A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form \(P(x)=ax^2+bx+c\) and is called a \textbf{quadratic function}. Its graph is always a parabola that opens upward if \(a > 0\) and downward if \(a < 0\).
\\\\
A polynomial of degree 3 is of the form 
\[ P(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d \text{ where } a \neq 0 \]
and is called a \textbf{cubic function}.
\\\\
A function of the form \(f(x) = x^a\), where \(a\) is a constant, is called a \textbf{power function}.
\\\\
A \textbf{rational function} \(f\) is a ratio of two polynomials:
\[ f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \]
where \(P\) and \(Q\) are polynomials. The domain consists of all \(x\)-values such that \( Q(x) \neq 0 \).

Notice that for both sine and cosine functions the domain is \((-\infty, \infty)\) and the range is the closed interval \([-1, 1]\). In addition, sine and cosine functions are periodic functions with a period of 2\(\pi\). 
$$\sin(x+2\pi)=\sin(x) \quad \quad \cos(x+2\pi)=\cos(x)$$
\textbf{Exponential functions} are functions of the form \(f(x)=b^x\) where the base \(b\) is a positive constant.
\\\\
\textbf{Logarithmic functions} are functions written as \(f(x)=\log_b(x)\), where the base \(b\) is a positive constant, are the inverse functions of exponential functions.
