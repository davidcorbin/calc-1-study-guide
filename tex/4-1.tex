\section*{4.1 Areas and Distances}

The area \(A\) of the region \(S\) that lies under the graph of the continuous function \(f\) is the limit of the sum of the areas of the approximating rectangles:
$$ A = \lim_{n \to \infty}R_n = \lim_{n \to \infty}[f(x_1) \Delta x + f(x_2) \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_n) \Delta x] $$
written with summation notation as 
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_i^*) \Delta x $$
