\section*{5.2 Volumes}

\subsubsection*{Definition of Volume (Disk Method)}

Let \(S\) be a solid that lies between \(x=a\) and \(x=b\). If the cross-sectional area of \(S\) in the plane \(P_x\), through \(x\) and perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis, is \(A(s)\), where \(A\) is a continuous function, then the volume of \(a\) is 

\[ V = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n A(x_i^*) \Delta x = \int_a^b A(x) dx\]
