\section*{1.4 Tangent and Velocity} 

A \textbf{tangent} is a line touching a curve. A tangent line has the same direction as the curve at the point of contact. A secant line, on the other hand, cuts throught the curve more than once.
\\\\
To find the tangent at a point on a curve (in slope-intercept form: \(y=mx+b\)), we must find the slope \(m\) at that point and use it to find \(b\) (the \(y\)-intercept). 

\subsection*{Average Velocity}

$$\text{average velocity} = \frac{\text{change in position}}{\text{elapsed time}}$$
