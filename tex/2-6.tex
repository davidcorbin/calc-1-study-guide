\section*{2.6 Implicit Differentiation}

Implicit differentiation is a way of solving a derivative by differentiating both sides of an equation with respect to \(x\) and the solving the resulting equation for \(y'\).

\subsubsection*{Example}

Find \(\frac{dy}{dx} \) of \( x^2+y^2=25 \).

\subsubsection*{Solution}

Differentiate both side of the equation.
$$ \frac{d}{dx}(x^2+y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(25) $$
$$ \frac{d}{dx}(x^2)+\frac{d}{dx}(y^2)=0$$
\(y\) is a function of \(x\) so we use the chain rule.
$$ \frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \frac{d}{dy} (y^2) \frac{dy}{dx} = 2y\frac{dy}{dx}$$
$$ 2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 $$
Solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).
$$ \frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{x}{y} $$
